- 👋 Hi, I’m Roberto Ruiz-Duarte, and I've taught myself to code. I am father and a husband who lives in Bromley (South London, UK) with his family. I always have an interest in computers and what you can do with them, now I want to discover what AI can do in the near future. 

- 👀 I’m interested in JavaScriptS/ES6, HTML, CSS, ReactJS, AI, VS Code, movies, fitness, writing non-code (I write screenplays, yep), technology in general, and sport cars. These and many other things, but we better leave something for later on. 😉


- 📚 I’m currently learning more React, and React Native (there is always room for improvement), and anything interesting that I find online, everyday there is something new in daily.dev (and I guess that's why they called it 'daily').


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects, I'll know it when I see it, but you know who you are. The team is very important, a collaborative and supportive space, with options to keep growing professionally and learning new stuff would be amazing.


- 📫 How to reach me? On my email robertnova@outlook.com is the easiest way; I guess a call should be the easiest, but if I don't know your number... well, you get it.
